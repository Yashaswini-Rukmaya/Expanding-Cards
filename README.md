The Expanding Cards project is a fun and interactive way to showcase content using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project features a set of cards, each containing an image or content snippet. 
When a card is clicked or hovered over, it expands to reveal more information while simultaneously shrinking the other cards. 
This creates a dynamic and visually appealing user experience that encourages exploration and engagement.
